# MACHINE LEARNING of Bersih.Kan

This project develops a Waste Disposal Site (WDS) recommendation system in Yogyakarta City. Using Machine Learning techniques, this system can provide WDS recommendations based on user preferences. The data used comes from the WDS data in Yogyakarta City. The Machine Learning team collecting and preprocessing waste facility data from government owned public data. Processing location data to be fed onto the recommendation machine. Building recommendation model using TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow, providing several recommended facilities. 


# DATASET

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the WDS data in Yogyakarta City. This data includes information on the location of the WDS, capacity, types of waste accepted, and other relevant factors.

# ENVIRONMENT PREPARATION
#Import Library
To start, we need to import the necessary libraries. Here, we use TensorFlow as the main library.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
```

# TRAINING DATA PREPARATION
Before starting to train the model, we need to prepare and process the data. This includes separating the data into training and testing sets, normalizing the data, etc.

# MODEL DEVELOPMENT
The model is built using TensorFlow. We use an architecture suitable for the recommendation system.

# MODEL TRAINING
After the model is built, we will train the model with the training data.

#CONVERT MODEL TO TENSORFLOW LITE
After the model is trained, we will convert it to the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for more efficiency and integration into mobile applications.

# CONSLUSION
This project is a step forward in waste management in Yogyakarta City through the use of Machine Learning technology. It is hoped that this system will help improve efficiency in waste management.
